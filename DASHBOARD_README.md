# ANZHFR Patient Information Dashboard

A simple, user-friendly dashboard for viewing hip fracture care statistics based on patient characteristics.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Using a Local Web Server (Recommended)

1. **Convert the data to JSON** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   python3 convert_data_to_json.py
   ```

2. **Start a local web server**:
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   
   # Or Python 2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/dashboard.html
   ```

### Option 2: Direct File Opening

If you're using Chrome or Edge, you can try opening `dashboard.html` directly, but you may encounter CORS issues. If you see errors, use Option 1 instead.
